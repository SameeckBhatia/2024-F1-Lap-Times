# F1 PACE: Performance Analysis and Comparison Engine

Welcome to F1 PACE. Here, I analyze lap time data sourced from the
Ergast API, focusing on the 2024 Formula One World Championship. My goal is to
examine differences in **constructor pace**, **driver lap times**, and the
**evolution of lap times** throughout each race. Through the use of **Python** and
**R** to create insightful visualizations, I plan to uncover trends and patterns
that define the thrilling dynamics of Formula One.
